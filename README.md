# FARS

This package was created as a task of the Coursera Coursera "Building R Packages".
The package is mainly concerned with dealing data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting System, which is a nationwide census providing the American public yearly data regarding fatal injuries suffered in motor vehicle traffic crashes. At the current state only some useful functions are provided.
